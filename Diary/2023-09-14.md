just a shell of its former self
best days are behind it
it'll never be the same

it's taken some hits 
but it's still standing
that's grit
that's what inspires people

serenity

jock

glamorous

methodically clawing up the mountain
ruthlessly defeating your enemies
emerging victorious
not dithering around in some meadow
