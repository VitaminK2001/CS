there are forces in the universe that we don't understand
measurable forces that can't be explained
but cannot be denied

I've been putting on a brave face to squash the darkness inside of me
I'll have to smother her with a pillow to spare her the pain

I'm intrigued but i have a list of demands

your crazy conspiracy theories just cost me a friend
conspire -> secretly detriment

have epiphany right now

as a young men, we'd hike this path up to an old oak tree
where we'd brainstorm how to conquer the closet universe
we foolishly thought that we knew everything back then
but hopefully i've learned a few things through the years
like live today as if there's no tomorrow
that it's not too late to right past wrongs
when things are looking down, look up
or take chances you never imagine you would

clamor -> vehemently shouting 
portrayal 
unconvincing
minimize inflammation
exfoliate your skin whilst wearing them
tiara
denim
desecrating
a quick thaw
in a feud with
how he single us out
shed our dead-weight spouses
instinctually complete it -> innate fixed pattern of behavior

adept at handling failure
the inverse of 
walls may be adorned with nothing but degrees and awards
but they don't have one tenth of your emotional intelligence

berserk umpire
pine tar
adrift
he has not shut up about it since
precinct
prosecutor
arthritis

The expression "coming on a tad strong" is often used to describe someone's behavior when they are being excessively forceful, intense, or assertive in a situation, conversation, or interaction. It suggests that the person's approach may be overwhelming or too aggressive for the circumstances, and they may be pushing their agenda, feelings, or intentions more strongly than is considered appropriate or comfortable by others.

For example, if someone is meeting a new acquaintance and immediately starts sharing very personal information or making intense demands, you might say that they are "coming on a tad strong." It's a way to convey that their behavior is making others feel uncomfortable or uneasy due to its intensity.
