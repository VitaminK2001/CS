我叫陈其高，来自湖北武汉，是中南大学计算机学院计算机科学与技术卓越人才培养的学生。
本科期间，我的学习重心在数学、算法和英语上，在编译原理、图论与组合数学、高等计算机算法，操作系统，计算机网络，计算机组成原理均为90+成绩。并积极参加学科竞赛，获NECCS全国三等奖，目前CCFCSP排名单次23.84%。
目前我想要深入研究的方向是目标检测与跟踪，因为我希望能通过自己的努力为国家的智能汽车、虚拟现实等科技创新领域贡献力量。

I am a student in the Department of Computer Science, 20th Turing Class, Central South University.

During my undergraduate studies, my academic focus has been on mathematics, algorithms, and English. I have achieved gratified grades, scoring above 90 in many specialized courses. I have also actively participated in academic competitions and received a National Third Prize in the NECCS competition. Currently, my ranking in CCFCSP is in the top 23%.

I am deeply interested in the field of object detection and tracking. I aspire to contribute to the advancement of technology in areas such as intelligent automobiles and virtual reality, and I believe that through my dedication and hard work, I can make a meaningful contribution to my country in these domains."

Throughout my research journey, which has been concurrent with my academic studies, I acknowledge that there are areas where I can improve. For instance, I recognize the need to enhance the intensity of my code training.

I utilize code repositories on GitHub as a resource for learning and reference, and I aim to develop the skill of independently using code to address research questions once I identify them.

A senior student who is pursuing her master's degree at Central South University once said, "Research ability is synonymous with learning ability. Don't wait until you've completed all the preparatory work before tackling the problem."

Upon hearing this statement, I have since focused on cultivating the ability to learn while solving problems. When encountering unfamiliar points in research papers or code, I delve into the literature, asking questions from the perspectives of "What," "Why," and "How."

我目前的第一志愿就是推免中南大学研究生。目前的情况是9.10考核结束后若通过，在能够拿到保研名额的情况下，顺利成为中南大学研究生。

如果能够顺利获得研究生名额，我首先想要提升的就是自己相应的编程能力，为之后的编写代码打基础。进一步就是了解不同方面的突破和创新点，然后研读论文，找复现代码学习。

如果研究生通过后我会进一步加强自己的英语能力，争取在今年年底考过雅思。

如果研究生推免未能通过，我会准备考研，如果能够考上中南，希望还能成为刘姝老师的学生。
