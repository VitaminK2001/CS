Dear Campus Leadership and Faculty,

I would like to express some suggestions regarding campus life at our school. I have always valued our institution and hope to see it continuously improve.

Firstly, I'd like to mention our school library. The library is a crucial place for student learning and research. However, I believe we can enhance this facility further. To improve the student learning experience, I suggest extending the library's opening hours, especially during evenings and weekends. This would provide more students with access to library resources and additional study time.

Furthermore, I think the school could strengthen its support for students' career development. Providing opportunities for internships, workshops, and career counseling services will help students better prepare for their future careers. Additionally, I suggest the school foster more partnerships with industry collaborators to offer students more practical experience.
