# 2022【图片描述】两个学生站在一张校园讲座的海报前，一个人说，不是我们专业的，听了也没多大用。另一个说，听了或许也有用。

The drawing depicts two students standing in front of a campus lecture poster. One of them is saying, "It's not our major; it won't be very useful to listen." The other student responds, "Listening might still be useful."

This drawing conveys a meaningful message about the value of education and learning. The two students represent two different attitudes towards knowledge and education. The first student's comment reflects a prevalent attitude where some individuals believe that learning something outside their major or area of expertise is a waste of time. They may think that it won't directly benefit their career or future.

The second student, on the other hand, represents a more open-minded perspective. They acknowledge that learning can have value beyond immediate career prospects. Education is not just about acquiring specific job-related skills; it also broadens one's horizons, fosters critical thinking, and helps individuals become more well-rounded and informed citizens.

In my opinion, the drawing reminds us that knowledge and learning have intrinsic value. Even if a lecture or course doesn't directly relate to our major, it can still enrich our lives, broaden our perspectives, and lead to unexpected opportunities. Therefore, we should approach education with an open mind, as it can offer benefits beyond what we might initially perceive.

# 2021【图片描述】：儿子和爸爸说：“爸爸，很多同学觉得唱戏不好玩”，爸爸对儿子说：“你自己不是喜欢吗，那就足够了”。

In the ==heartwarming scene== captured in the picture, a young boy converses with his father. The boy, with a slightly ==perplexed== expression, relays the opinions of his classmates, saying, "Dad, many of my peers don't find opera singing enjoyable." In response, his father imparts a valuable life lesson, stating, "If you find joy in it, my child, that's all that matters."

This ==simple yet profound== interaction between father and son offers a deeper insight into the essence of individuality and passion. It ==underscores the significance of== pursuing one's interests and passions, even when they deviate from the mainstream or face criticism from others.

In a world often ==driven by conformity== and the need for ==external validation==, the father's wisdom serves as a reminder that personal fulfillment is derived from within. The boy's genuine enthusiasm for opera singing is a testament to the uniqueness of human interests and the ==boundless potential within us to find happiness in our individual pursuits==.

This image and the father's response encourage us to embrace our passions, regardless of societal expectations or the opinions of others. It reminds us that ==authenticity and personal fulfillment== are the ultimate sources of happiness and success.

The picture depicts two contrasting scenes at a study table. In the foreground, we see a diligent child, fully engrossed in completing their homework. With a determined expression, they are writing and proclaim, "Only when it's finished early can I be at ease." In the background, there is another child, lounging back in their chair, seemingly uninterested in the task at hand. They casually remark, "I won't move a finger until the very last moment."

The implied meaning in this picture reflects the age-old battle between ==procrastination== and diligence. It highlights the two distinct approaches people take towards their responsibilities. The child in the foreground represents the proactive and disciplined approach, emphasizing the importance of completing tasks early to alleviate stress and ensure peace of mind. On the other hand, the child in the background symbolizes procrastination, an attitude that can lead to last-minute chaos and potentially subpar results.

This image reminds us that our choices in managing our responsibilities can significantly impact our lives. It serves as a philosophical reminder that taking the proactive path, being diligent, and completing tasks in a timely manner can lead to a more tranquil and successful life, while procrastination often brings unnecessary stress and diminished outcomes. In essence, it prompts us to consider whether we want to be the child in the foreground, diligently working, or the one in the background, waiting until the eleventh hour.

It vividly illustrates the different strategies people employ when faced with their responsibilities.

The deeper meaning here encourages an active and efficient lifestyle. By completing tasks early, we can ==avoid the anxiety and urgency of procrastination==, allowing more time for reflection, improvement, and enjoyment. It conveys the idea that through proactive action, we can better control our lives, reduce stress, increase efficiency, and gain more opportunities and freedom.

# 2019【图片描述】：两个人在登山，其中右边一个人垂头丧气的坐在台阶上，抱怨说“累了，不想爬”，而左边一人，背着背包，递给他一杯水，并且说“别，休息一下接着爬”

In the heart of a steep mountain, two individuals embarked on an arduous journey. The scene captured in the picture speaks volumes about the human spirit and the power of empathy.
【speaks volumes about】：there is a significant or profound message or insight to be gained from the subject being discussed or observed

To the right, we see a person who appears to be on the brink of surrender, their eyes downcast, their body slumped on the rocky steps. They lament, "I'm exhausted, I can't go on." This individual represents the struggles we all face in life, ==those moments when we are overwhelmed by fatigue and self-doubt==. The mountain they climb is a metaphor for life's challenges, and ==their weariness is a reflection of the burdens we bear==.

On the left, we encounter a different soul. This person is not only carrying their own backpack but also extending a helping hand, offering a refreshing cup of water. Their compassionate words resonate with wisdom: "Rest a while, then continue the climb." This act of ==kindness and encouragement embodies the essence of empathy==, reminding us that in our darkest moments, there are always those who support and uplift us.

The image encapsulates a profound lesson. ==Life is full of peaks and valleys==, and the journey can be strenuous. However, it is our choice whether to succumb to despair or embrace the empathy of others to help us persevere. Just as the climber on the left offered not only water but also hope, let us remember that a kind word and a helping hand can make all the difference on our uphill battles. The path may be tough, but with compassion and resilience, we can conquer even the steepest mountains of life.

【peaks and valleys】：emphasize the fluctuating nature of life and encourages individuals to navigate both positive and negative aspects with determination and resilience

Certainly, let's focus on the theme of resilience in the essay.

---

In the journey of life, we often find ourselves amidst the ==undulating terrain of challenges and successes==. Life, as they say, is full of peaks and valleys. What sets individuals apart during this journey is their resilience.

Resilience is the unwavering spirit that keeps us going even when the path gets tough. ==It's the determination to ascend the peak== even when the valley seems endless. We all have our moments when the weight of the world presses down, making it tempting to give up, but resilience is the invisible force that whispers, "Keep going. You've got this."

Consider a mountaineer facing a ==daunting climb==. At some point, ==fatigue sets in, doubts cloud the mind==, and the weight of the backpack becomes overwhelming. In such moments, ==it's not the strength of the muscles but the strength of character that carries them forward==. It's the belief in one's ability to overcome obstacles, one step at a time.

Resilience doesn't mean avoiding valleys; it means==facing them head-on==. It's not about never stumbling, but about learning to rise every time we fall. Just as a hiker might pause to catch their breath before resuming the ascent, we, too, can take a moment to regroup, then ==forge ahead== with newfound determination.

In the grand symphony of life, ==resilience is the melody that accompanies us through every peak and valley==. It's the reminder that no matter how tough the climb, with perseverance and inner strength, we can conquer any summit. As we navigate this unpredictable journey, ==let us carry the torch of resilience, for it's not the destination, but the tenacity to reach it, that truly defines our life's story==.

There are, as is ==symbolically and explicitly== demonstrated in the cartoon above, two individuals climbing a mountain, with one guy on the left wearing a bag on the back and a beaming smile on the face who is encouraging the other one, unexpectedly, sitting on the half way and wanting to give up, which indicates the importance of persistence.

Obviously, these two guys directly ==epitomize a prevailing social phenomenon== that is in life’s journey. Some people with keen eyesight can stick to their dreams, while others, on the contrary, may easily give up despite there is encouragement and accompaniment from their teammates. Hence, we cannot overemphasize the significance of persistence, with which we can overcome all adversities and hardships in long-term life’s journey. Otherwise, we would end up in failure and live in despair. Taking basketball player Yao Ming for example, he can slam-dunk smartly because he does his utmost in pursuing his dreams and never gives his ideal up.

From the preceding discussion, it is readily apparent that ==persistence is a pre-requisite== on our way to success, since life is a long journey, while sticking to why we start is a must to the destination. Only by making constant efforts and never stopping making progress can we expect a bright and promising future!
