# "They are supposed to blouse, not cling" 
is a phrase that typically refers to the way certain clothing items, like shirts or blouses, should fit or drape on the body. Let's break down the meaning:
1. **Blouse**: A blouse is a type of loose-fitting, often women's garment that typically drapes gracefully over the upper body. Blouses are designed to have a bit of extra fabric and are not meant to fit tightly. They are known for their comfortable and flowing style.
2. **Cling**: When something "clings," it means it sticks closely or tightly to the body, conforming to its shape. In the context of clothing, if a garment clings, it usually fits snugly and doesn't have the loose, flowing quality of a blouse.

# condescending pity
"Condescending pity" is a term used to describe a particular attitude or behavior in which someone expresses sympathy or compassion towards another person but does so in a way that comes across as patronizing, arrogant, or superior.
